2. write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript?

       Objects in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
 These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
 (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)

For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
